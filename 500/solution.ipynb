    "A quick sieve tells us that the 500500th prime is $7,376,507$. We can raise some small primes to higher powers to compensate for large primes, but it scales very quickly with the power. For instance, if we raise $2^{15}$ to $2^{31}$, we multiply by $2^{16} = 65,536$ which is worthwhile, but if we instead raise to 63rd power, we need to additionally multiply by $2^{32}$ is not worthwhile.\n",
