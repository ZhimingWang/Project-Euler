    "We're looking for numbers of the form $pqr$, $p^3q$ and $p^7$. The last form is trivial. For the previous two, once we fix $pq$ or $p^3$, it boils down to calculating $\\pi(N/pq)$ or $\\pi(N/p^3)$. For small enough $n$, we can simply calculate $\\pi(n)$ via binary search on a pre-generated prime list. This works up to $10^9$, but the memory and computation cost of generating the whole prime list becomes a bit too high once we're in the $10^10$ range. Fortunately we only need to calculate $\\pi$ for a few hundred values over $10^9$. Instead of writing a fast algorithm myself I simply pre-computed the table in Mathematica (~6s)."
