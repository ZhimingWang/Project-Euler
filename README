Programs to some of the early problems I solved were lost. See /log for
information. (Those dated back to when I was still an Xcode moron.)

The remaining programs are not guaranteed to always work, either (though I
believe most, if not all of them, are in good standing, provided that you
modify the Makefile and header path a little), since the shared libraries has
changed a lot ever since first written. I tried to maintain them in their
original shape (you may still see traces of early, silly code), but when I do
need to move forward I don't care about backward compatibility, aka historical
stupidness.
