Programs to some of the early problems I solved were lost. See /log for
information. (Those dated back to when I was still an Xcode moron.)

The remaining programs are not guaranteed to always work, either (though I
believe most, if not all of them, are in good standing, provided that you
modify the Makefile and header path a little), since the shared libraries has
changed a lot ever since first written. I tried to maintain them in their
original shape (you may still see traces of early, silly code), but when I do
need to move forward I don't care about backward compatibility, aka historical
stupidness.

Update (04/28/2013)

Today I successfully boosted my collection to 150 problems (out of the current
425), level 6. Up till this point, I feel that I need to enrich myself before
proceeding any further. After all, I have so many interesting (but a priori
hard) things to accomplish, so I cannot indulge myself in the false illusion of
confidence arised in solving easy problems.

At this point, the length of leaving is unclear. Maybe for a while,
maybe for ever.
