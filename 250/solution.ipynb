    "First we calculate the remainder mod 250 of all terms, putting them into buckets. Bruteforce power mod (even Python's `pow`) is fast enough here, but we may use one trick just to feel good: it's easy to prove a slightly extended version of Euler's theorem here with the help of Chinese remainder theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^103 \\equiv a^3 \\pmod{250}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for all $a$. Then it's very easy to show that if $b \\equiv a \\pmod 500$, Then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b^b \\equiv a^a \\pmod{250}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So at most we need to calculate the first 500 terms; the rest follows via periodicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we felt good and have the number of terms $\\equiv r \\pmod{250}$ for each $r$, we start from $r = 0$ and build up the subset counts. We let the total number of subsets built from terms $\\equiv 0,\\,1,\\,\\dots,\\,r \\pmod{250}$ s.t. the subset sum $\\equiv r' \\pmod{250}$ be $f(r, r')$. We further define $g(s)$ to be the number of subsets built only from terms $\\equiv r \\pmod{250}$ s.t. the subset sum $\\equiv s \\pmod{250}$. Apparently $g(s)$ is easily calculable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(s) = \\sum_{0\\le k \\le n,\\ kr \\equiv s} \\binom{n}{k},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of $\\equiv r$ terms. Also, apparently\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(r, r') = \\sum_{r'' + s \\equiv r'} f(r-1, r'') g(s).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $r > 0$ and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(0, r') = g(r').$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $f(r, r')$ can be calculated iteratively for each $r$. Eventually we're only interested in $f(249, 0)$. Don't forget to subtract 1 though since the problem asks for the number of *non-empty* subsets. As always this successfully got me the first time round.\n",

    "The slightly optimized Python implementation took ~3s."
