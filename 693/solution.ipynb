    "This is actually the first time I looked at a Project Euler problem soon after it came out. I didn't bother to start early, and it took me a few hours between reading the problem description and submitting the result, mainly because my \"algorithm\" was run in two sittings and took *two hours*, but I still managed to squeeze in at 59th, landing me two badges. All in all, not bad.\n",
