    "We need to find prime power $p^k$ s.t. $d = 2017 \\mid 1 + p + p^2 + \\cdots + p^k = \\frac{p^{k+1}-1}{p-1}$. Then $p^{k+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod d$, so $\\mathrm{ord}_d(p) \\mid k+1$. We know $\\mathrm{ord}_d(p)$ must be a divisor of $d - 1 = 2016$, and we need $p^k \\le N = 10^{11}$. We can easily eliminate all $k \\ge 5$ by looking at small primes $< 200$ (note $200^5 > 10^{11}$):\n",
