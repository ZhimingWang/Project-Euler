It is trivial to show that
\[
A_F(x) = \frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}.
\]
Therefore, the problem boils down to finding positive integers $n$ such
that
\[
n x^2 + (n+1) x - n
\]
is reducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, i.e., the discriminant $5n^2 + 2n + 1$
is a perfect square, say $m^2$. We can write this as a Pell equation
\[
\left(\frac{5n+1}{2}\right)^2 - 5\left(\frac{m}{2}\right)^2 = -1.
\]
Obviously for the ring of integers $\mathscr{O}_K$ of $K =
\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$, the group of units $\mathscr{O}_K^\times$ is
the cyclic group generated by $(1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2$. Therefore, all
positive integer solutions $n$ and $m$ satisfy
\[
\frac{5n + 1}{2} + \frac{m}{2} \sqrt{5} =
\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^k
\]
for some positive integer $k$. Upon further inspection, $n$ is
integeral if and only if $k \equiv 1 \mod 4$. Therefore, the 15th
golden nuggest can be easily obtained by calculating $(1 + \sqrt{5}) /
2$ raised to the 61st power (the first power gives $n = 0$, which
needs to be excluded). The answer turns out to be $1120149658760$.
