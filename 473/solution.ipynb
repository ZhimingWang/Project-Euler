    "It's not hard to notice that the coefficients of $\\sqrt{5}$ are $\\pm$ every other term in the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that every positive integer can be uniquely written as the sum of nonconsecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Therefore, in order to sum up to integers, we must pair up $S(2j)$ and $S(2j+3)$, with an optional standalone $S(1)$. At this point we can simply perform BFS on the pairs to generate all sums, subject to the constraint that no two consecutive powers appear in the decomposition, which can be easily guaranteed with a mask. (Note that $S_0$ and $S_3$ are forbidden because $S_0 = \\phi^0 + \\phi^{-1}$ is the sum of two consecutive powers.)\n",

In the future, just always use ULL... (I must have \"learned\" this lession dozens of times during my 15 years of programming, yet here we are.)"
