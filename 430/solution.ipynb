    "Express each flip as a vector of $1$s and $-1$s, where $-1$ represents flipped. Then the final result is simply the elementwise product of all vectors, which are independent. By uniform distribution and distributive law of elementwise product, the expectation of the final state is simply the expectation of a single step vector raised to $M$-th elementwise power. Let the final white count expectation be $E_W$ and black count expectation be $E_B$, and let the elementwise sum of the expectation of the final state vector be $E_d$. Then apparently,\n",
