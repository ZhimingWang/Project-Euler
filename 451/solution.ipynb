    "In practice, instead of CRT all the way through, which will result in $2^t$ solutions in the general case where $t$ is the number of unique prime factors of $n$, I use CRT on the two largest prime powers, resulting in 2 or 4 solutions (some $\\pm r$ in addition to $\\pm 1$) $\\mod {p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2}}$ or $\\mod {p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} / 2}$, then brute force to find the max square root. This should be fairly simple, but I somehow got knee deep in various two powers, and spent upward of an hour debugging my crappy program... Anyway, eventually got it, ~50s."
