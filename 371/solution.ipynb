    "Let $2n = 1000$. We randomly select numbers from $[0,\\, 2n-1]$ (with replacement) until either we select $n$ twice, or we have one of the pairs $(1,\\, 2n-1)$, ... $(n-1,\\, n+1)$. The number $0$ is useless. Since the pairs are all equivalent, we have $2n+2$ states: let state $2k$ be the state where we have picked $k$ distinct unpaired numbers but not $n$ ($k \\le n-1$); let state $2k+1$ be the same as state $2k$ except $n$ has been picked exactly once; and state $2n+1$ be the remaining, i.e. the \"done\" state.
