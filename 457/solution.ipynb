This turns out to provide an imperceptible speedup, and is largely pointless.\n",

    "(I stupidly sabotaged myself with a garbage statement and wasted a lot of time on this... When I'm testing out `n_sqrtmod_primepow`, in order to make the program compile (with `-Wall -Werrors`) I added a statement `sum += x1 + x2` so that the `sum` variable isn't unused. Then I forgot to kill that statement... Then I was bewildered by why the sum of $R(p)$ plus the sum of all those square roots wasn't correct for like twenty minutes...)"
