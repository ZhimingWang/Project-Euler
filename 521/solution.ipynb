    "I first wrote an inclusion-exclusion principle-based implementation (`solution2.cc`) but it's way too slow since it basically enumerates all squarefree integers under $N$. It takes >2hr even for 10^8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I wrote another brute force leveraging the fact that any $n$ is uniquely written as $p \\cdot n/p$ where $p$ is the smallest prime factor of $n$, and all prime factors of $n/p$ are $\\ge p$; so we can enumerate $m = n/p$, where for each $m$, the smallest prime factor of $q \\cdot m$ is $q$ for all $q \\le$ the smallest prime factor of $m$. This strategy lends itself well to parallelism. Using OpenMP with my 12 virtual cores, the result is calculated in ~$10^4$s CPU time, or ~14min wall clock time.\n",
