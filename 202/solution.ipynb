    "Expand the triangle by reflection into a triangular grid. The laser ray simply becomes a straight line intersecting with segments in the grid as it goes. We can easily show that in order to intersect with $(2k-3)$ segments before hitting a point the rectangular grid should have $k$ segments on each side. Now put a barycentric coordinate system on the grid where coordinates $(a, b, c)$ sum to $k$. Let $C$ be $(k,0,0)$, and the other two vertices of the grid be $(0,k,0)$ and $(0,0,k)$. We can easily see that reflections of $C$ are the gridpoints satisfying $b - c \\equiv 0 \\pmod3$; on the edge opposite to $C$ they are $(0, b, k-b)$ where $b \\equiv -k \\pmod3$. We need to count all such points where $(b, k-b) = 1$, or equivalently $(b, k) = 1$, so that the light ray doesn't hit other grid points before it hits $(0,b,k-b)$.\n",

    "There's probably an analytical solution to the problem of counting $b$ s.t. $(b, k) = 1$ and $b \\equiv -k \\pmod3$, but the size of this problem is within brute force range. My C++ implementation took ~3.7s. Obviously Python is thrown out of the window, no way it could finish a 3E9 loop in reasonable time.\n",

    "(Looking at the analytical solution someone provided in the forum thread, I just realized how much elementary number theory knowledge I have lost over the years. Mobius inversion has almost been erased from my memory.)"
