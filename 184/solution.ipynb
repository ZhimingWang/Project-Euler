    "Out of the 224 PE problems I've solved, this one probably took the longest to analyze (two to three hours?). It wouldn't have taken this long if I took a brute force shortcut halfway, but somehow I was determined to find an analytical solution and eventually I got it. It is indeed satifying to have a program that finishes instantly, even on inputs much larger than the original.\n",

    "And amazingly enough, when I'm writing the solution up, I found another much cleaner method which was a natural step following one of my key observations.\n",

    "Strategy: consider a polar coordinate system on the disk, assigning each point excluding the origin an angle $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. Denote the multiplicity of the angle $\\theta$ (among internal integer points) as $k(\\theta)$. Order all $\\theta$ and assign indices, so that $\\theta_0 = 0 < \\theta_1 = \\arctan\\frac{1}{n-1} < \\theta_2 < \\cdots < \\theta_l = \\pi /2 < \\cdots < \\theta_{4l-1} = \\pi - \\arctan\\frac{1}{n-1}$. Let $k_j = k(\\theta_j)$, e.g. $k_0 = k_l = k_{2l} = k_{3l} = n-1$, $k_1 = k_{l+1} = k_{2l+1} = k_{3l+1} = 1$. Let $N$ be the total number of integer points excluding the origin, then\n",

    "Now we make one important observation: counting the number of triangles containing the origin is equivalent to counting the number of triangles not containing the origin and whose vertices lie on three distinct diagonals, with multiplicity 3. To wit, for each triangle containing the origin, we can reflect each one of its vertices about the origin to form such triangles; and for each such triangle, call it $\\triangle ABC$, WLOG the radius extending $OB$ strictly lies within the $<\\pi$ angle formed by radii extending $OA$ and $OC$ (the angle is calculated counterclockwise by arc so could be $\\ge \\pi$), then reflecting $B$ about the origin gives us a triangle containing the origin. Equivalently we need to count such radii triples $(OA,\\, OB,\\, OC)$, or their corresponding angles $(\\alpha,\\, \\beta,\\, \\gamma)$ with multiplicity, which is my original idea."

    "A neater observation following the above (which I only thought of when I was writing this up) is that the number of triangles containing the origin is exactly $1/4$ of the total number of triangles whose vertices lie on three distinct diagonals, regardless of whether it contains the origin. This, in turn, is equivalent to picking three distinct diagonals and picking one non-origin point on each. Recall that by the opening definitions, there are $2l$ diagonals each with $2k_0$, $2k_1$, \\cdots $2k_{2l-1}$ non-origin points on them, therefore we have the generating function\n",

    "This method isn't necessarily very fast if we delegate a lot of work to a symbolic engine (I'm using `sympy`'s polynomial implementaion and only helping it a little bit by expanding each $(1+2kx)^e$ factor to $x^3$). But it's certainly beautiful."
