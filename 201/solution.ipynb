    "Divide and conquer, calculate the sums of $k$-element subsets of a given $n$-element set for all $1 \\le k \\le n$ by calculating the Cartesian products of divided subsets. The straightforward implementation is slow, takes ~4 min in C++. There are quite some optimizations possible, the most important probably being a linear scan from minimum sum to maximum sum except a Cartesian product when the range is much smaller than the size of the product set with duplicates.\n",
