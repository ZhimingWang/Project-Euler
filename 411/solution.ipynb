    "Once we topologically order all stations by their x coordinates, it simply becomes a problem of longest non-decreasing subsequence problem with a well-known $O(n\\log n)$ algorithm. See [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence).\n",

    "There are two ways to deduplicate and topologically order all stations by x coordinates: (1) map x coordinates to sets of y coordinates; (2) just put all coordinates in a vector and sort the whole thing. I first implemented (1), turns out `std::map` and `std::set` are too slow to be worth it. To be precise, (1) took ~141s whereas (2) took only ~26s. Of course, preemptive deduplication using mathematical properties of $(2^i,\\, 3^i)$ is possible, but not worth the programmer effort."
