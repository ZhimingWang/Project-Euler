The divide-and-conquer memoized search cover these cases just fine and probably takes a trivial amount of time, but I implemented a binomial mod function (with general modulus, not only primes) just for the hell of it. This turned out to be my undoing (for a few minutes anyway) because $11^12$ is too large to not overflow 64-bit int when multiplication is in the picture..."
