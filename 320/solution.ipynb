    "My basic idea is binary search around $1234567890i$ for $N(i)$. Every time $\\nu_p(n!) \\ge 1234567890 \\nu_p(i!)$ for all relevant $p$ we set the upper threshold to $n$, and every time it doesn't hold for a subset of primes we set the lower threshold to $n$ and update the set of primes we need to test to that failing subset. The only problem is it's too slow to test all primes $\\le i$, and I'm not entirely clear which subset is sufficient, so I took a greedy approach and filtered the targets by excluding $p$ where $i \\mod p$ is above a certain threshold. The threshold can be very lenient without affecting the performance much.\n",
