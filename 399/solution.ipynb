    "A little bit of observation and experimentation tells us that if $f_{n_p}$ is the first Fibonacci term that is divisible by prime $p$, then $p^2 \\mid f_n$ iff $p \\cdot n_p \\mid n$. Therefore we only need to filter out all multiples of $p \\cdot n_p$ for all primes $p$. Note that the $N$-th squarefree term is roughly the $1.3N$ overall term (the ratio converges for obvious reasons), so it's safe to filter for $p \\cdot n_p$ up to $1.5N$.\n",

    "The obvious choice for the searching and filtering is C++, which is fast and imperative and familiar, but the actual Fibonacci term calculation is obviously vastly simpler in Mathematica, so we leverage both."
