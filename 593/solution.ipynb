    "Clearly a ranged median query program. Since my OI days are way behind and I don't know any advanced algorithm any more, I simply borrowed [someone else's](https://www.reddit.com/r/algorithms/comments/7pafxe/interview_question_range_median_query/dsg18nv/) [algorithm](https://gitlab.com/willypillow/CompetitiveProgramming/blob/2395ff281f3d44870b5508fb284205e965df0408/UVa/13183.cpp). Solves the problem in 5.5s, could be optimized at the cost of program complexity.\n",

    "Strangely enough allocating the node pool as static (the node pool is large, $2 \\times 10^8 \\times 24$ bytes so that we don't need to free anything until the end) is crazy taxing on the compiler. Clang manages to use ~50GB (!!!) of RAM to compile this program! Not really sure what's going on. Allocating the pool at runtime doesn't have this problem, but makes the code uglier."
