    "A very easy problem, clouded by one huge gotcha. I think the \"difficulty\" and seeming lack of online blog posts about this problem is predominantly due to the gotcha.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easy part: let $(a, b) = g$, $a = a_0 g$, $b = b_0 g$, then $a_0 b_0 | 10^n$, and $g \\cdot p = \\frac{(a_0 + b_0) 10^n}{a_0 b_0}$. Therefore $a_0$ and $b_0$ are severely constrained and it boils down to calculating a few divisor counts. So far so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I misinterpreted the question as the number of pairs $(a, b)$, i.e., if the same pair sum to both $10/10$ and $100/100$, that's considered one solution. When I submitted my answer and got a wrong answer response, I was confused. I even wrote a brute force to verify my results. Yep, same. Super confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually I had to cheat a little and found a forum comment that pointed to the ambiguity. Apparently they were asking for the number of distinct $(a, b, n, p)$ tuples. Okay. Fair enough. In hindsight, not really ambiguous technically speaking. But I don't think I'm in the minority for misinterpreting it."
