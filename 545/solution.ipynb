    "$20010 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 29$, so we're looking for multiples of $2^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 = 308$ with no other divisor $d$ s.t. $d+1$ is prime. If one multiple of 308 has an additional prime minus 1 divisor, all multiples of this multiple has that divisor too, so the problem lends itself well to a sieve method. A brief test shows that the frequency of such numbers among all multiples of 308 is around $1/30$, so we only need to sieve up to ~$30 \\times 10^5$.\n",

    "My first implementation uses FLINT's `arith_bernoulli_number_denom` for a very short program, but it's too slow because FLINT has to factor the number from scratch each time. I then implemented my custom Bernoulli denominator function for multiples of 308 taking advantage of free factorization of the 308 part and using a precomputed sieve for the remaining multiplier. It's very fast so the implementation generates the result within half a second."
