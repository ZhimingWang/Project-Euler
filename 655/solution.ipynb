    "For palindromes of length 32, listing all $0.9 \\cdot 10^{16}$ of them is of course hopeless, but note that the 16-digit sequence can be chopped into two halves where the remainder counts for each half with either $0.9 \\cdot 10^8$ or $10^8$ possibilities can be computed and then combined. The C++ implementation took ~30s. This approach really only works for length $\\le 32$ before it becomes too expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general solution for any length is to store remainder counts of palindromes of a certain length, then add a digit to the beginning and end to obtain the remainder counts of palindromes of length plus 2. I thought of this at first but after entertaining it for maybe half a minute I decided for whatever reason the time complexity is out of reach... Such an idiot."
